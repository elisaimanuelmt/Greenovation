        <h2>Greenovationâ€™s First Workshop at Yestoya Orphanage, Surabaya</h2>
        <p>
          On June 8th, 2024, the Greenovation Team held a valuable workshop at
          Yestoya Orphanage in Surabaya, involving children of various
          educational levels, from kindergarten to those who are already
          working. This workshop was part of Greenovation's efforts to educate
          and empower the community through sustainable living programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop began with a presentation on environmental themes, energy
          conservation, and the positive impacts of water hyacinth processing.
          We provided an in-depth explanation of the importance of protecting
          the environment and how simple daily actions can contribute to
          sustainability. The material was designed to give participants clear
          and practical insights into relevant environmental issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we conducted games and ice-breaking sessions that were designed
          to strengthen togetherness while staying connected to the topics
          discussed. These interactive activities not only made the atmosphere
          more enjoyable but also ensured that participants could absorb the
          information more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, we guided the participants through the practical process of
          turning water hyacinth into paper. This process began with collecting
          the water hyacinth from rivers and water reservoirs, followed by
          cleaning and boiling. Then, the water hyacinth was cut, blended, and
          its fibers were extracted to be molded into sheets of paper. Each step
          of the process was thoroughly explained so that participants could
          fully grasp the concept and acquire useful practical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, we collaborated with the non-profit organization
          AllForOne to provide food and beverages for the participants,
          demonstrating our care for their well-being. Greenovation also
          contributed by providing snacks. We hope that participants not only
          gained valuable knowledge but also felt our care through the practical
          aspects of the workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all these activities, we hope that participants can apply the
          knowledge and skills they gained to develop their own business ideas,
          ultimately improving their economy and contributing positively to the
          environment.
