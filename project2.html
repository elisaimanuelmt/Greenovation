        <h2>Collaboration with Water Hyacinth Craftsmen (Witrove)</h2>
        <p>
          On September 2nd, 2024, we had the privilege of visiting Witrove, a
          company specializing in transforming water hyacinth into eco-friendly
          products. During our visit, we met Mr. Supardi, the husband of the
          founder, Mrs. Wiwit, who shared the inspiring story behind their
          business. Mrs. Wiwit initially attended a 10-day water hyacinth
          empowerment program in 2007, which sparked the idea of turning this
          abundant and inexpensive plant into valuable products. Together, they
          established Witrove with the aim of creating sustainable solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Supardi explained how the companyâ€™s sales experienced a
          significant boost after they showcased their products at the Jatim
          Expo, an event that supports local businesses. Their presence at the
          expo also garnered media attention from Kompas, a major news outlet,
          further boosting their visibility. Witrove has effectively leveraged
          social media and online marketplaces to reach a broader audience, and
          their products are now sold internationally through platforms like
          Shopee in Singapore, the Philippines, and Malaysia.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a profit of 1.5 billion rupiah from their water hyacinth
          ventures, Witrove has also been invited to international exhibitions
          in places like Amsterdam and Korea. In addition, the local government
          has enlisted them to train communities on cultivating and processing
          water hyacinth, furthering their positive impact on both the local
          economy and the environment. The success of Witrove reflects the
          dedication and collaboration of Mrs. Wiwit and Mr. Supardi, whose
          efforts have taken their business to new heights both locally and
          globally.
