        <h2>Workshop at SDN Manyar Sabrangan, Surabaya</h2>
        <p>
          On October 4, 2024, Greenovation held an educational workshop at SDN
          Manyar Sabrangan, Surabaya. The workshop aimed to educate students on
          the importance of managing organic waste, especially water hyacinth,
          and to introduce its potential to be transformed into valuable
          products.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop began with a presentation on environmental themes, energy
          conservation, and the positive impacts of water hyacinth processing.
          We provided an in-depth explanation of the importance of protecting
          the environment and how simple daily actions can contribute to
          sustainability. The material was designed to give students clear and
          practical insights into relevant environmental issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          The event began with an introduction by the Greenovation team, warmly
          welcomed by the students and teachers. The first session was an
          interactive presentation on the negative impact of uncontrolled water
          hyacinth growth on the environment and its potential as a resource for
          business opportunities. Students were encouraged to think critically
          about how waste, which often seems useless, could be turned into
          valuable products like recycled paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the presentation, the students engaged in a hands-on activity to
          make recycled paper from water hyacinth. They followed each step of
          the process â€” from crushing the water hyacinth into pulp, pouring it
          into molds, and drying it to produce sheets of paper. This part of the
          workshop captured the students' attention, as many of them were
          experiencing this process for the first time. Some students
          encountered difficulties in spreading the pulp evenly in the molds,
          but with guidance from the Greenovation team, they managed to produce
          paper sheets successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          To keep the students energized, a short ice-breaking game was
          conducted in the middle of the session. However, managing the
          students' excitement during the game proved to be a challenge. To
          address this, the Greenovation team decided to switch to a more
          structured and engaging activity that kept the students focused and
          actively involved.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop concluded with a reflection session and a discussion on
          entrepreneurship. The Greenovation team introduced the students to the
          idea of turning recycled paper into marketable products, such as
          eco-friendly paper for crafts or notebooks. The students showed great
          enthusiasm as they imagined creating and selling their own products.
          The teachers also appreciated the initiative, as it provided the
          students with not only technical skills but also an early introduction
          to entrepreneurial thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this workshop, Greenovation hopes to inspire students to
          become more environmentally conscious and foster an entrepreneurial
          spirit from a young age. By equipping them with waste management
          skills and business insights, the goal is to nurture a generation that
          actively contributes to sustainable environmental and economic
          solutions.
