        <h2>Workshop at Petra 3 Junior High School, Surabaya</h2>
        <p>
          On September 20th, 2024, the Greenovation Team held a valuable
          workshop at Petra 3 Junior High School in Surabaya, involving students
          from various educational levels. This workshop was part of
          Greenovation's efforts to educate and empower the community through
          sustainable living programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop began with a presentation on environmental themes, energy
          conservation, and the positive impacts of water hyacinth processing.
          We provided an in-depth explanation of the importance of protecting
          the environment and how simple daily actions can contribute to
          sustainability. The material was designed to give students clear and
          practical insights into relevant environmental issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, we conducted games and ice-breaking sessions that were designed
          to strengthen togetherness while staying connected to the topics
          discussed. These interactive activities not only made the atmosphere
          more enjoyable but also ensured that students could absorb the
          information more easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, we guided the students through the practical process of
          turning water hyacinth into paper. This process began with collecting
          the water hyacinth from rivers and water reservoirs, followed by
          cleaning and boiling. Then, the water hyacinth was cut, blended, and
          its fibers were extracted to be molded into sheets of paper. Each step
          of the process was thoroughly explained so that participants could
          fully grasp the concept and acquire useful practical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          With all these activities, we hope that participants can apply the
          knowledge and skills they gained to develop their own business ideas,
          ultimately improving their economy and contributing positively to the
          environment.
